Give a presentation of your pipeline to your classmates on the designated day.
The presentation should include:
    An explanation of the dataset
    The goals of the analysis
    Presentation of the visualizations used (nxviz, seaborn, matplotlib, Pyvis, SigmaJS)
    Conclusions



    Explain what your dataset is.                                                                                           // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
    Explain what the nodes and edges are.                                                                                   // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
    Explain if it was necessary to filter nodes or generate a subgraph.                                                     // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"It was a connected dataset that had been reduced by 20x, from almost 6.5k nodes to 330 nodes, where each node is a marvel character and each link is them appearing on the same comic book. I used pyvis for the Interactive network visualization and Matplotlib for the Static plots for degree and centrality distributions, using Github, Colab, Streamlit, and Gephi for the deployment and presentation of the network, with the objective of exploring how marvel builds one of the biggest fictional universes in media and how their characters are connected to each other"



    Adjacency matrix                                                                                                        // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"The adjancency matrix is symmetric as the graph is undirected"



    Diameter and periphery of the network                                                                                   // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"Many periphery nodes and very small diameter as the graph is a Scale Free network as we'll see"



    Sparsity/Density of the network                                                                                         // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"Highly sparse due to few main characters and many minor ones such as family, love interest, friends, minor villains and heroes"



    General assortativity of the network                                                                                    // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
    Empirical degree distribution histogram                                                                                 // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"We can observe a clear PowerLaw distribution, with the presence of few high degree hubs with low degree nodes connected to them, showing it's similar tp a Scale Free Network. That means it is very vulnerable to targeted attacks on the hubs while being resilient to random attacks"



    Local clustering coefficient for selected nodes                                                                         // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
    Global clustering coefficient                                                                                           // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"That means Global clustering medium, while local clustering can be high for a few characters"



    Strongly Connected Components (note: the graph must be directed for this metric)                                        // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
    Weakly Connected Components                                                                                             // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"N/A because the graph is undirected"



    Eigenvector centrality                                                                                                  // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"How many important people I know"
    Degree centrality                                                                                                       // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: V
"How many people I know"
    Closeness centrality                                                                                                    // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: X
"How many interactions it takes to reach others"
    Betweenness centrality                                                                                                  // INCLUDE: V EXPLAIN: X
"How many shortest paths go through me"
