"Nodes: 327; unimodal*
Edges: 9,891; weighted; undirected

The nodes csv contains 327 different Marvel characters, and the edges csv contains 9,891 weighted relationships between those characters, which were calculated based on how many times two characters appeared together in the same comic book.

To explore and understand the edges better, you might take a look at the bimodal edges list and the comic book key from the Marvel Chronology Project. For more on the methodology, see Rossell√≥, Alberich, and Miro's original article.

In order to make this data more accessible for basic social network analysis, I have condensed the network from 6,486 characters to only the top 327 most connected characters, who are connected to at least 8 other characters and with whom they appear in at least 5 different comic books."
